## About Me

Hello! I'm Ruben Sierra, a programmer on a journey of self-discovery in the tech world.

🎓 My tech journey began in 2022 when I started studying Higher Technician in Network Computer Systems Administration. This experience ignited my curiosity and passion for programming.

🚀 Currently, I'm honing my skills at 42 Barcelona, where I'm diving deep into various programming languages and technologies.

💻 I'm a self-taught enthusiast, constantly learning and improving my coding skills. My diverse background combines formal education with self-directed learning, giving me a unique perspective in problem-solving.

🔍 I'm actively seeking my first programming job, eager to apply my knowledge and contribute to innovative projects.

🌱 My journey from network administration to programming has been exciting, and I'm looking forward to the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead in the tech industry.

Feel free to reach out if you'd like to connect or collaborate!
